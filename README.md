Hello, I'm John Underwood. I'm a husband of 20 years and father of two wonderful young people learning to adult. I enjoy DIY rehabs done well and love cast iron cooking. I'm a recent transplant to Southern California and have really started enjoying beach clean up. I'm learning to enjoy puzzles and every now and then I'll have a hot green tea instead of coffee. I really enjoy reading Fantasy such as Robert Jordan's [Wheel of Time series](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/books-and-art/#cosmere) or Brandon Sanderson's [Stormlight Archive series](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/books-and-art/#cosmere).

I currently serve as the Vice President of Information Security for [Big 5 Sporting Goods](https://www.big5sportinggoods.com/store/). In this role I oversee SOX and PCI compliance and collaborate with internal legal counsel in running the Privacy program. I hold the [CISM](https://www.isaca.org/credentialing/cism), [CIPM](https://iapp.org/certify/cipm/) and [GSTRT](https://www.giac.org/certifications/strategic-planning-policy-leadership-gstrt/).  Additionally, I serve on the governing body of [Southern California CISOs for Evanta](https://www.evanta.com/ciso/southern-california), [IT Security Council for the National Retail Federation](https://nrf.com/about-us/committees-councils/it-security-council), [SANS Advisory Board](https://www.giac.org/about/community/) and a member of the [Retail and Hospitality ISAC (RH-ISAC)](https://www.rhisac.org/).

I have an eclectic background ranging from physical security in the US Army and strategic Dept. of Energy sites to Information/Cybersecurity in both public and private organizations.  I've developed both security and privacy programs from scratch. My security program was solid enough to support an ISO 27001 certification and the privacy program supported GDPR  for an international organization doing business multiple EU countries.  

So, the posts on this site are ideas, questions and explorations of thought from an InfoSec practitioner.
