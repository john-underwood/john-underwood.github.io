#### Who I am
I'm John Underwood. I'm a husband of 20 years and father of two wonderful young people learning to adult. I enjoy DIY rehabs done well and love cast iron restoration and cooking. I'm a  transplant to Southern California and have started enjoying beach clean up. I'm learning to enjoy jigsaw puzzles and every now and then I'll have a hot green tea instead of coffee. I enjoy reading Fantasy such as Robert Jordan's [Wheel of Time series](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/books-and-art/#cosmere) or Brandon Sanderson's [Stormlight Archive series](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/books-and-art/#cosmere).

#### What I do
I currently serve as the Vice President of Information Security in the retail space. In this role I ensure that our security program and roadmap meets the risks of a changing threat landscape and aligns with the corporate strategy.  I also oversee SOX and PCI compliance and collaborate with internal legal counsel in running the Privacy program. 

I hold the [CISM](https://www.isaca.org/credentialing/cism), [CIPM](https://iapp.org/certify/cipm/) and [GSTRT](https://www.giac.org/certifications/strategic-planning-policy-leadership-gstrt/) certifications.  

I participate and serve the InfoSec community in the following ways:
 - [Governing Body of Southern California CISOs for Evanta](https://www.evanta.com/ciso/southern-california), 
 - [IT Security Council for the National Retail Federation](https://nrf.com/about-us/committees-councils/it-security-council), 
 - [SANS Advisory Board](https://www.giac.org/about/community/)
 - A member of the [Retail and Hospitality ISAC (RH-ISAC)](https://www.rhisac.org/).
 - Advisor for a 100% SaaS based GRC start company in the prelaunch phase. 

When availability allows, I also mentor junior security profesionals and coach people in how to get into the field.

#### Why this site 
In Feb 2020, I attended a week long security conference with 36,000 of my closest friends from around the world.  I left with a case of COVID 19.  While it wasn't severe enough to be intubated, I was bedridden for several weeks and weak for several months.  As of January 2022, I still suffer from long term neurological problems associated with [Long Hauler's Disease](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/covid-long-haulers-long-term-effects-of-covid19).  Specifically, I fight [brain fog](https://www.neurosection9.com/brain-fog-symptoms/), fatigue, headaches and dizziness.  I deal with other COVID related issues as well, but the impact of the symptoms listed above is that I'm no longer able to join panels or speak publicly without anxiety and sever "word searching".  It can be pretty annoying for the people in the audience.  Essentially, I don't feel as if I'm able to contribute to my professional community in the same way I used to.

So, this project is a way for me to exercise my mind by working out what I'm thinking and learning (and in some cases - re learning) in a semi public forum.  It's also an outlet to contribute back into the InfoSec community. 

I hope my notes/posts are as helpful to others as they are to me.
